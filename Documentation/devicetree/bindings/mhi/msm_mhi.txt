MSM MHI

MSM MHI enables communication with a device over a PCIe link using the
Modem Host Interface protocol. The bindings referred to below, enable
the correct configuration of the interface and required sideband
signals.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "qcom,mhi"
  - Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/esoc/esoc_client.txt" for
    below properties:
	- esoc-names
	- esoc-0
  - Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
    below optional properties:
	- qcom,msm-bus,name
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths
	- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps
  - mhi-chan-cfg-#: mhi channel configuration parameters for platform
    defined as below <A B C D>:
	    A = chan number
	    B = maximum descriptors
	    C = event ring associated with channel
	    D = flags defined by mhi_macros.h GET_CHAN_PROPS
  - mhi-event-cfg-#: mhi event ring configuration parameters for platform
  - mhi-event-rings: number of event rings supported by platform
  - mhi-dev-address-win-size: size of the MHI device addressing window

Example:

	mhi: qcom,mhi {
		compatible = "qcom,mhi";
		esoc-names = "mdm";
		esoc-0 = <&mdm1>;
		qcom,msm-bus,name = "mhi";
		qcom,msm-bus,num-cases = <2>;
		qcom,msm-bus,num-paths = <1>;
		qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps =
				<100 512 0 0>,
				<100 512 1200000000 1200000000>;
		mhi-event-rings = <6>;
		mhi-chan-cfg-102 = <0x66 0x80 0x5 0x62>;
		mhi-event-cfg-0 = <0x80 0x0 0x0 0x11>;
		mhi-dev-address-win-size= <0x10 0x00000000>;
	};
